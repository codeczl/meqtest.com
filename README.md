# Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ Test)

## Overview
The Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) is a scientifically validated assessment tool designed to determine your chronotype - whether you're naturally more alert and productive in the morning or evening. Our MEQ test helps individuals understand their natural biological rhythms and optimize their daily schedules accordingly.

## What is the MEQ Test?
The MEQ test (Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire) was developed by researchers Horne and Östberg in 1976 and has become the gold standard for determining individual chronotype preferences. This self-assessment questionnaire helps identify whether you're a:
- Morning type ("Lark")
- Evening type ("Owl")
- Intermediate type

## Features of Our MEQ Test Platform
- **Scientific Validity**: Based on the original Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire research
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-complete questionnaire format
- **Instant Results**: Get your chronotype assessment immediately
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Receive tailored advice based on your MEQ score

## Benefits of Taking the MEQ Test
Understanding your Morningness-Eveningness profile through the MEQ test can help you:
1. Optimize your daily schedule
2. Improve sleep quality
3. Enhance productivity
4. Better plan important tasks
5. Make informed lifestyle choices

## Scientific Background
The Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) consists of carefully designed questions that assess:
- Preferred sleep-wake times
